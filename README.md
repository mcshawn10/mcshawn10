Hello world!

My name is Shawn McNeill, current master's student of electrical engineering at University of Texas at San Antonio.
While my degree is what it is, my interests are definitely more CS focused, ie software/data.

As Bruce Lee said, "I fear not the man that has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but the man that has practiced 1 kick 10,000 times.
It is for that reason that all my projects are in Python. I'd rather be a Python expert than decent in 2-5 languages. I'm sure as time goes by I will learn more,
but for now, Python it is.

Hope you like what you see, more projects on the way. please reach me at my contacts below:
